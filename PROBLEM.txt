This chapter shares similarities with chapter 2, with key differences highlighted in bold.
Meta employees love two things: building cool products and scaling them up. As a new intern, you just started work on a cool product, but you want to make it even cooler during your internship.
Initially, your empty product has coolness 
1
1. Each of the next

N
2×N days, you'll make a change, multiplying your product's coolness by any positive integer of your choice subject to the following requirements:
After the first 
N
N days, the coolness can be at most 
A
A (you're new to the codebase, so you shouldn't scale too quickly).
After all

2×N days, your product should have coolness exactly

Please find any sequence of

Sample Explanation
In the first sample case, your product must have a coolness of at most

2×N=4 days. One possible solution is to scale up by 
[

[1,3,3,7] respectively. After each day, this leaves coolnesses of 
[
1
,
3
,
9

63
]
[1,3,9,63] at the end of each day respectively.
While there are multiple acceptable solutions to this case, one solution that would not be accepted is 
[

[7,1,3,3] because it has coolness
